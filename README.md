## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The main goal of Second Hand Shelf is to provide a functional ecommerce experience to simulate the ability for users to browse products, add them to their basket and to checkout and receive order confirmation via email.

* As a developer a focal goal was to improve on the basic functionality of an ecommerce website, this involved developing multiple additional features to improve user experience and extend the use of the site. These additional features are as follows:
  * Wishlist functionality
  * Rating and Review functionality for books
  * A contact form that sends users an email to confirm that their message has been received and will be responded to within 48 hours
  * Inspired by other second hand book shops like [World of Books](https://www.wob.com/en-gb) I created dynamic pricing whereby the price of a book differs depending on the quality of book selected
* As always accessibility was at the heart of the design and development of this site, ensuring that the site is easily accessible to all regardless of abilities. Not only is this the duty of developers but also encourages users with different abilities to be able to purchase items from the site, making this a business goal also

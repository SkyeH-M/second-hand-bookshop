# Second Hand Shelf

Second Hand Shelf is a second hand book selling website, users can browse books by genre, or by different filtering criteria like alphabetised title, year of release, language, price, or rating. They can also view specific offers like clearance items, or new releases. Basic functionality of the site is comprised of the user being able to register for an account, log in and out, and complete orders by paying and receiving a confirmation email. Additional functionality has been added for user experience and this will be discussed further on in the document.

## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The main goal of Second Hand Shelf is to provide a functional ecommerce experience to simulate the ability for users to browse products, add them to their basket and to checkout and receive order confirmation via email.

* As a developer a focal goal was to improve on the basic functionality of an ecommerce website, this involved developing multiple additional features to improve user experience and extend the use of the site. These additional features are as follows:
  * Wishlist functionality
  * Rating and Review functionality for books
  * A contact form that sends users an email to confirm that their message has been received and will be responded to within 48 hours
  * Inspired by other second hand book shops like [World of Books](https://www.wob.com/en-gb) I created dynamic pricing whereby the price of a book differs depending on the quality of book selected
* As always accessibility was at the heart of the design and development of this site, ensuring that the site is easily accessible to all regardless of abilities. Not only is this the duty of developers but also encourages users with different abilities to be able to purchase items from the site, making this a business goal also

## Design
### Colour Scheme

![Image of colour scheme](/docs/images/colour-palette.png)

The colour scheme of the Second Hand Shelf is primarily comprised of black, white and different shades of green.

* The background is white to ensure the site is clean and readable and that the users' focus is always on the colours of the products instead of them being distracted by a busy background
* The site text is predominately black and dark grey, again to ensure readability but also to provide enough contrast with the white background
* The green colours highlighted throughout the site were chosen to evoke feelings of reliability and affordability given that the site is for a second hand book shop

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the fonts featured in the site, both fonts used are of the type sans-serif to maintain consistency

![Image of Stripe Element Font](/docs/images/inter-font.png)
* I used the font Inter for the stripe elements in the checkout page as it's clearly readable and dyslexia friendly which is especially important when users are trying to place an order

![Image of Body and Title Font](/docs/images/cabin-font.png)
* I chose the Cabin font for both the header and body of the site so that text is consistent and always readable. Having important text such as the Title and page headers displayed in uppercase helps to highlight information that the user should pay attention to

### Icons and Images

* All icons used throughout the site were provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as their style is aesthetically pleasing while being consistent and easily understandable
* I sourced an icon from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com) that will be attributed in the credits section of this document. I then used [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) to convert this png to an icon file and imported that to my site. I installed a Favicon to help users distinguish this tab from others in their browser, the simple book related design and bright colours help to do this.
* All product images will be attributed in the credits section, along with the hero image on the home page
* The home page image serves to provide an aesthetically pleasing and colourful element to the page while making clear that this site is a bookshop 

### Models
I created 3 unique models for this project, Bookreview, Contact, and Quality, and designed a model schema diagram to illustrate the relationship between models. I used [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/diagrams) to create these diagrams and was limited by the data types available on their site so some of the data types listed are incorrect. The accurate data and model field types can be found in each respective models.py file but I still wanted to use this software to illustrate the relationship between models. The DrawSQL site doesn't allow Foreign Keys to be attached to the entire model and so I have had to link fields to other specific fields where again this is inaccurate to the actual models. Below is the model diagram purely for representational purposes, the models coloured in pink are the ones I created from scratch for this project
![Model image](/docs/images/models.png)

### Features
The Second Hand Shelf is comprised of 12 core sections: Home page, Signup, Login, Profile, Wishlist, Products view, Book Detail, Book Reviews, Shopping Bag view, Checkout, Checkout Success, Contact Us

* All pages feature the main nav bar, on desktop this includes the title, search bar which can search for terms in book titles, blurbs or information like the author of a book. The My Account drop down features Product Management which is only accessible for the superuser (or site management) and can be used to add, edit, or delete products. The My Wishlist page, and My Profile pages can also be accessed through this dropdown, along with being able to log out if a user is logged in. The Contact form is accessible through the Contact Us icon, and the bag icon displays up to date bag total information which can be clicked to bring the user to the Shopping Bag page. The main navbar also features a Home page link for users on mobile, the All Books link to show all products which can filtered in the menu. Books by Genre allows users to select and view only books from specific genres, and the Special Offers button allows users to view the New Releases, and Clearance sections.
* Each page also includes a footer displaying copyright information and social media links for the site
* All pages on the site are responsive across multiples different screen sizes, on smaller screens like mobile phones the top navbar is condensed into a hamburger menu to ensure the screen isn't cluttered while maintaining the same functionality as that found on larger screens.
* For all actions a user performs on the site a pop up message will appear either confirming that their requested action has been successful or giving them details of the action they've just performed. For example, adding, removing, or altering a product in the shopping bag will all be accompanied by messages unique to the action performed.

| Section | Feature | Photograph or gif |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Home page features an image of a book shop, along with cards that showcase different books or groups of books to encourage users to view the Clearance, and Horror/Mystery sections along with the Best Seller of the month | Upon loading the site users are greeted with the home page image which aims to draw their attention as the colours pop against the white background and this immediately conveys the purpose of the site as one that sells books | ![Home Image](/docs/images/home-image.png) |
| | The Home page displays 3 cards which feature different aspects of the products available, the Clearance section to encourage users to shop for deals, the Horror/Mystery section as it's a section I enjoy, and the Best Seller of the month. Each image is clickable and brings the user to the relevant section described in the text shown | ![Book Features](/docs/images/book-features.png) |
| The Sign Up page allows users to register for an account with the site | The sign up form encourages users who already have an account to sign in instead by showing both a text link and button to redirect users to the Log In page | ![Sign Up Form](/docs/images/sign-up.png)
| | The Sign Up form asks users to input their email address which must be unique to their account, choose a username which again must be unique to their account and has a maximum length set by Django as 150 characters. The username field permits users to use special characters, numbers and letters to allow for usernames to be unique if there's a large client base. The form then asks the user to set a password, confirm their password and click the Sign Up button. All fields on the Sign Up form are required and the user cannot click Sign Up without successfully filling in these fields. | |
| The Log In page allows users to log who have registered for an account to log in to their already existing account | It encourages users who do not yet have an account to register before attempting to log in by providing a text link to the Sign Up page | ![Sign In page](/docs/images/sign-in.png) | 
| | The Log In form asks users to input their username, or email and their password, if a username or password combination is entered that doesn't exist an error displays stating "The username and/or password you specified are not correct" | ![Log In error](/docs/images/username-password-error.png) |
| | There is a radio button with the text 'Remember me' that allows users to select whether they want their log in information to be saved for the next time they visit the site | ![Remember me box](/docs/images/remember-me.png) | 
| | Django comes with ready-made password reset functionality so users are able click a link stating they forgot their password. This redirects them to a page where they can enter their email address and an email with a link to reset their password is sent to their specified address | ![Password Reset](/docs/images/password-reset.png) |
| The Profile page includes sections for a user's default delivery information, and their order history | The Profile page allows users to input their default delivery information so this information can be saved to their account and autofill on the checkout page, this isn't only a quality of life change but might encourage more users to go through with a purchase if the system is quick and easy | ![Default Delivery Information](/docs/images/default-delivery.png) | 
| | The Profile page displays a user's order history with information including their order number, date and time of purchase, the items and quantities order, and their order total. When then order number is clicked it brings users to their order confirmation which is initially displayed after a purchase made been made | ![Order History](/docs/images/order-history.png) |
| The My Wishlist page allows users to view and edit their wishlist, though only if they are logged in | If a user has no items in their wishlist they are met with a message 'You currently have no books in your wishlist, click the button below to find your new favourite read...'. Along with a button that redirects users to the All Books page | ![No books in wishlist view](/docs/images/wishlist-empty.png) |
| | When a user has added an item to their wishlist they can view this book in their My Wishlist page, here the book cover image, title, author and blurb are displayed. The price on this page is displayed as the price for quality 'Great', with text explaining that qualities of 'Fair' and 'Good' will be reduced. There is also a button where users can remove this item from their wishlist. | ![Wishlist with book](/docs/images/wishlist.png) |
| The Products view shows all books available for sale, it allows users to filter by Genre or Special Offer and to sort by price, rating, alphabetised title, and alphabetised genre. | Clicking any of the genre/special offer buttons takes the user to a page that only displays books that match their request. The 'sort by...' box allows users to sort from low to high on price and rating, to let them find deals or the best books on the site | ![All Books view](/docs/images/all-books.png) |
| | The book pages (whether All Books or a filtered genre page) display books in cards with the book cover image, title, author, language, release year, price (for quality 'Great'), and the genre or special offer tag. If the book hasn't been rated or reviewed it stated 'No rating' but once reviews have been made it shows the average rating out of 5 aggregated across all users. For site managers like the superuser there are also edit and delete buttons for product stock control. Due to the amount of books displayed on each page there is a 'back to top' button to allow users to quickly and easily return to the top of the page | ![All Book Cards](/docs/images/all-books-card.png) |
| The Book Detail page is accessed when a user clicks on the title or image of a book on the All Books (or any genre/special offers) page. Each book detail page shows information about that book exclusively, along with letting users add it to their wishlist, add to their bag, or rate or review the book | This page displays the book's image, title, author, average rating (if this has been rated, otherwise it shows 'This book hasn't been rated yet'), a button to bring users down to the rating and review form, book length, year of release, price, tags, and blurb. If a user adds a book to their bag a message pops up confirming that this item has been added, and the bag icon in the navbar updates based on the price. | ![Book details page](/docs/images/book-details.png) |
| | The 'add to wishlist' button is featured prominantely above the cover image and when clicked adds the book to the user's My Wishlist page. If a book is in a user's wishlist this button changes it's text to say 'Remove from wishlist' to let users manage their wishlist without having to go into their Wishlist page | ![remove from wishlist](/docs/images/remove-from-wishlist.png) |
| | The site users dynamic pricing meaning that depending on the quality of book a user selects and adds to their bag the price will be different. A 'Great' quality item is full price, 'Good' quality has a 20% discount applied, and a 'Fair' quality is discounted by 40% due to the second hand nature of the shop. This pricing is calculated dynamically but accurate item and grand totals are presented throughout the site. Underneath the quality the user can adjust the quantity of books they wish to add to their bag, this field cannot be manipulated to be lower than 1 or higher than 99. | ![Example of dynamic pricing](/docs/images/dynamic-pricing.gif) |
| The Book Reviews section is found on each book detail page and both displays all existing reviews from users and has a form in which users can submit their own rating and review | If no reviews have been made for a book there is text which states 'This book has no reviews yet...'. If reviews have been left they are displayed in a row which differs depending on screen size and utilises a horizontal scroll bar to display all reviews cleanly and clearly. Each review card shows the username of the reviewer, the review date (where more recent reviews appear first) and the stars they awarded the book out of 5. It is mandatory that stars be awarded to leave a review but submitting a written review is optional, if a written review is left it is displayed under the star rating. For the user who wrote each review that is displayed there will be edit and delete buttons only visible and accessible to them. If a user clicks the edit button they are taken to a form that is pre-populated with the content of their original review. If a user clicks the delete button a modal pops up asking if they are sure they wish to delete this as it's irreversible. In addition only superusers can leave multiple reviews for each book (for development purposes) and users who attempt to leave multiple reviews for one book will be met with a message saying this cannot be done. | ![Book Review Section](/docs/images/book-reviews.png) |
| | The book review form itself is simple and lets users input a star rating and a written review (if they wish) before clicking the submit review button | There is a note telling users that they must add a star rating in order to submit the review, a star rating is left by hovering over the number star they wish to award the book. The written review field has a maximum character attribute of 3000 as if a written review becomes longer than the size of the review card a vertical scroll bar allows users to scroll through and read the full review without this cluttering the screen. | ![Book review form](/docs/images/book-review-form.png) |
| The Shopping Bag view is accessed by clicking the bag icon in the navbar, this page shows the current contents of the bag along with product information | If nothing is in the bag text stating 'Your bag is empty' will display along with a button encouraging users to keep shopping. When an item (or multiple) is added a success message is displayed in the top right corner of the screen to let users know that their book has been added to the bag. This message explains which book, in which quality and quantity has been added along with the price and a message that has calculated how much more the user would need to spend to get free delivery. | ![Add to bag success message](/docs/images/add-to-bag-success.png) |
| | After clicking the bag icon the user sees the contents of their bag, including the book image, title, author, quality and SKU. The quantity of the book selected can be altered here using the quantity input, if this is altered the subtotal adjusts accordingly, items can also be removed from the bag using the remove button. The bag total is displayed lower down the page along with the delivery cost and grand total, with another message stating how much more the user would need to spend to receive free delivery. From here the user can either click 'keep shopping' to return to the books page, or click 'secure checkout' to proceed to the checkout page | ![Shopping bag page](/docs/images/shopping-bag.png) |
| The checkout page shows an order summary and then asks the user to fill out the details, delivery, and payment form to complete their order | The order summary consists of the book cover image, title, author, quality, and quantity with it's subtotal. The Delivery cost and grand total are displayed again | ![Checkout Summary](/docs/images/checkout-summary.png) |
| | The checkout form is comprised of fields for Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Street Address, Town or City, Post Code, and a dropdown country selector. There is also a radio button where users can opt to save this delivery information to their profile if they're logged in. If a user has previously opted to save information to their profile this form will be auto populated. The payment field is at the bottom of the form where users can enter their card details, along with a buttons that either redirect the user back to their bag or complete their order with Stripe validating their details. There is also a message displayed in red underneath this 'Complete Order' button to warn users that their card is about to be charged, and how much. All required fields of the form must be entered for the 'Complete Order' button to be clicked and the order to be successfully processed. When the 'Complete Order' button is clicked a green overlay appears on screen with a spinning arrow circle to demonstrate that the order is being processed. | ![Checkout Form](/docs/images/checkout.png) |
| The checkout success, or thank you page is reached after an order has been processed and displays the order information | The page confirms that the order has gone through successfully and tells the user which email their confirmation will be sent to. A development example of this confirmation email is shown in the images section of this table, and upon deployment this will send the confirmation email to the users real email address | ![Order confirmation email](/docs/images/order-confirmation-email.png) |
| | The order success page confirms the following details: order number, order date, the item(s) ordered along with the quantity, the full delivery details provided, and the full billing information. Below this is a button encouraging users to 'Check out the latest deals' which would redirect them to the clearance page and new releases page| ![Order confirmation](/docs/images/order-confirmation.png) |
| The Contact form can be accessed whether a user is logged in or not, and simply asks users to fill in the following information: their name, email, subject line, and message, a button is shown below to allow users to submit their message | All fields in this form are required and the form cannot be submitted without all being filled in correctly | ![Contact Form](/docs/images/contact-form.png) |
| | The contact form is set up to send a confirmation email to the user with their their message subject, and content repeated back to them so they have a copy of the communication. The email also states the Second Hand Shelf will respond within 48 hours, but if the message is urgent a contact number is listed | ![Contact form confirmation](/docs/images/contact-confirmation.png) |

* Future Implementations:
  * Ideally, I would like to streamline the process for site managers to add products to the site, the form works fine with every detail being easily input apart from the book quality and price variable. Currently for any new book added to the site the manager must go into the store admin and create 3 quality attributes for the book, one for 'Great' quality with a price_factor of 1.0, one for 'Good' quality with a price_factor of 0.8, and one with 'Fair' quality with a price_factor of 0.6. This seems tedious, or at worst could be forgotten by management which may cause issues with the site
  * In the future I'd like to implement functionality whereby users could resell their own books through the site much like how a site manager would upload a product currently, however this was beyond the scope of my project
  * I also wanted to potentially add a 'My Reviews' page to the site where users can view their own reviews of different books without having to search through all the existing reviews from other users. In addition, functionality whereby users could like or comment on others' reviews would make the site more engaging and interactive

### Accessibility
* Throughout the development of this site accessibility was a priority, semantic html, alt tags, and aria-labels are used wherever possible to assist screen readers. The fonts chosen are ones I believe to be dyslexia friendly and readable no matter what screen size the user is on.
* Lighthouse gave my site a score of 100 for almost all pages, with some having a score of 97, this demonstrates that I have prioritised accessibility throughout development and have implemented accessible features where needed. The only thing that downgraded my accessibility score is that on mobile testing it flags that there is no h1 element (this issue will be discussed further in the WAVE testing section).
![Lighthouse Accessibility Score](/docs/images/accessibility.png) 
* I used the [Ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/) to check for any colour contrast issues and received the following result
![ALLY result](/docs/images/ally.png)
* [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was utilised to test the web accessibility of each page on the site, the results of which are fully explored in the Automated Testing section further down in this document

### Wireframes
Before development began I designed wireframes to aid in the creation of my site, when these were created I didn't intend on including a contact form so unfortunately this is missing from the wireframes

## Testing
### Automated Testing

### W3 Nu HTML Validator
The W3 Nu HTML Validator was used multiple times throughout development to ensure the HTML used was all up to industry standards, the results are as follows:

* [Home page](/docs/images/home-html.png)
* [Sign Up page](/docs/images/sign-up-html.png)
* [Log In page](/docs/images/login-html.png)
* [Product Management page](/docs/images/product-management-html.png)
* [Wishlist page](/docs/images/wishlist-html.png)
* [Profile page](/docs/images/profile-html.png)
* [Contact Us page](/docs/images/contact-html.png)
* [All Books page](/docs/images/all-books-html.png)
* [Book Detail page](/docs/images/book-detail-html.png)
* [Shopping Bag page](/docs/images/shopping-bag-html.png)
* [Checkout page](/docs/images/checkout-html.png)
* [Checkout Success page](/docs/images/checkout-success-html.png)

### W3C CSS Validation Service
The W3C CSS Validation Service was used to validate the two CSS files contained within the project, the results are as follows:

* [Base.css](/docs/images/base-css-validator.png)
* [Profile.css](/docs/images/profile-css-validator.png)

The only CSS warnings given were '-webkit-user-select', '-moz-user-select', and '-ms-user-select' are vendor extensions so I didn't feel these needed to be addressed as they don't comprise the quality of the css

### JS Hint
JS Hint was used to validate the JavaScript found throughout the project with the results being:

* [Profile](/docs/images/profile-JS-Hint.png)
* [Stripe](/docs/images/Stripe-JS-Hint.png)
* [Quality Price Calculator](/docs/images/quality-price-calculator-JS-Hint.png)
* [Quantity Input Calculator](/docs/images/quantity-input-calculator-JS-Hint.png)

No errors were found on any of the JavaScript files or exerpts used, the screenshots show 'One undefined variable' being listed for multiple files but doesn't provide an explanation of this, or which variable it thinks is undefined. For this reason, along with me manually checking each file I have chosen to ignore this warning

### Python Linter

The following files were tested with a [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to ensure PEP8 compliance, and all files apart from settings.py passed with no errors.

* [Bag contexts.py](/docs/images/bag-contexts.png)
* [Bag views.py](/docs/images/bag-views.png)
* [Bag urls.py](/docs/images/bag-urls.png)
* [Bookshop urls.py](/docs/images/bookshop-urls.png)
* [Bookshop settings.py](/docs/images/settings.png)
* settings.py in the Bookshop app was the only file to show line length warnings, these affected the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS and were not created, or updated by myself so I have left them as Django intended
* [Checkout admin.py](/docs/images/checkout-admin.png)
* [Checkout context.py](/docs/images/checkout-context.png)
* [Checkout forms.py](/docs/images/checkout-forms.png)
* [Checkout models.py](/docs/images/checkout-models.png)
* [Checkout urls.py](/docs/images/checkout-urls.png)
* [webhook-handler.py](/docs/images/webhook-handler.png)
* [webhooks.py](/docs/images/webhooks.png)
* [Contact admin.py](/docs/images/contact-admin.png)
* [Contact forms.py](/docs/images/contact-forms.png)
* [Contact models.py](/docs/images/contact-models.png)
* [Contact urls.py](/docs/images/contact-urls.png)
* [Contact views.py](/docs/images/contact-views.png)
* [Home urls.py](/docs/images/home-urls.png)
* [Home views.py](/docs/images/home-views.png)
* [Products views.py](/docs/images/product-views.png)
* [Products admin.py](/docs/images/products-admin.png)
* [Products forms.py](/docs/images/products-forms.png)
* [Products models.py](/docs/images/products-models.png)
* [Products urls.py](/docs/images/products-urls.png)
* [Profile forms.py](/docs/images/profile-forms.png)
* [Profile urls.py](/docs/images/profile-urls.png)
* [Profile models.py](/docs/images/profiles-models.png)
* [Profile views.py](/docs/images/profiles-views.png)

### Wave Testing
* I assessed my site using WAVE before and after deployment to ensure there were no web accessibility issues present. The results of these tests are below:
* [Home page](/docs/images/WAVE-Home.png), the only warning present for the home page referred to a 'Skipped heading level' this relates to the page title being a h2, and the delivery banner being h1. If I altered this so that the title was a h1 and the delivery banner was lower I receive a warning about there not being a h1 heading on the mobile version of the page. Therefore, I am happy to leave this warning as it is
* [All Books page](/docs/images/Wave-all-books.png), there are 218 warnings listed as WAVE reported 2 warnings on the page which are multiplied by the number of books displayed. The warnings they raised are having a 'Redundant link' users can click the book cover image or the title to be taken to the book detail page, this is by design to give users choice. The other warning states that the price variable could be a 'Possible heading', I want the price variable to be a paragraph tag so that it fits in aesthetically with the book title, author, and other informational fields.
* [Book Detail page](/docs/images/Wave-book-detail.png) the only warning present here is a 'Suspicious link text' related to the 'Click here to Rate or Review' button, I feel as though this button text is clearly descriptive to users
* [Sign Up page](/docs/images/Wave-signin.png) 
* [Registration page](/docs/images/Wave-sign-up.png)
* [Contact page](/docs/images/Wave-contact.png)
* [Shopping Bag page](/docs/images/Wave-shopping-bag.png)
* [Checkout Confirmation page](/docs/images/WAVE-checkout-confirmation.png) The only warning presented for this page is a 'Redundant link' for the 'Check out the latest deals' button, I don't see where this link is being replicated, and the button is valuable for redirected users back to the products page
* Unfortunately I couldn't access pages that require the user to be logged in so I couldn't do WAVE testing on all pages but I have conducted manual testing on all pages.

* [Checkout page](/docs/images/lighthouse-checkout-m.png)
* [Checkout Success page](/docs/images/lighthouse-checkout-success-m.png)

* Reflections:
* I am mostly satisfied with the Lighthouse results for desktop but I recognise that the mobile performance scores are not as good as I would like them to be. The main advice Lighthouse gave to improve mobile performance scores was to implement an efficient cache control policy, I did this through the AWS S3 website which improved performance scores. I was unable to eliminate render-blocking resources as when I added a defer attribute to script files in base.html it rendered the Stripe payment box unusable and removed the toast messages from the site.
* I recognise that site performance is vitally important for user experience but at this time I am unable to improve these scores further without sacrifising the functionality of the site so I have chosen to leave this as it is.

  * When Product Management is clicked it brings the superuser to the add book form where all required fields must be filled in to submit the form. The 'edit' and 'delete' links on the all books and book detail pages direct to the correct pages/actions and can only be accessed or seen by the superuser
  * Clicking 'add to wishlist' on the book detail page for a product adds this book to the user's wishlist which can be viewed by clicking the 'My Wishlist' tab, this also updates the button to say 'remove from wishlist'. When the remove from wishlist button is clicked the book is removed from the wishlist
  * If a user clicks the 'My Profile' link, enters their default delivery information and clicks 'update information' this information is saved and will be used to autofill the checkout details form

  * The star rating field logs the correct value according to how many stars are coloured in green when the user clicks the star they wish to rate the book 
  * The written review is optional and the form can therefore be submitted without this being filled in, though the star rating is required and the form will not submit without it
  * The written review field has a maximum length of 3000 characters to ensure users have as much freedom as possible in writing their review
  * A superuser can leave multiple reviews per book for development and testing purposes but other users are only permitted to leave 1 review per book, if they attempt to add another they are given a warning message
* Shopping Bag page:
  * If the user has nothing in their shopping bag the page will be empty aside from a message that states 'Your bag is empty' with a button encouraging the user to view the books on offer
  * When a book is added to the shopping bag a success message detailing the bag contents is shown, clicking either 'Secure checkout' or the bag icon brings the user to the shopping bag page. Here a summary is shown and users can adjust the quantity of items, or remove them, clicking 'Secure checkout' here brings user to the checkout page
* Checkout page:
  * If users are logged in and have saved information to via their profile the checkout details form will be pre-populated with this data, all required fields must be filled in in the correct format

### User Testing
This site was tested by three individuals on different devices in order to ascertain whether the site functions correctly for others. This also provided a very valuable opportunity for me to be made aware of any bugs that I hadn't noticed.
The site was tested by Rossanne Hamilton from my CI cohort, my partner Isabelle Harley, and my dad Neill Milton
* Rossanne Hamilton tested the site on a Gigabyte Gaming Laptop, she reported no notable errors but did notice one bug. Thankfully Rossanne noticed that when ordering products by rating (high to low) products with no rating appear before those with low ratings. I was then able to resolve this issue and have documented it in the bugs section below.
* Neill Milton tested the site on a Mac desktop and found no issues related to either aesthetics or functionality
* Isabelle Harley tested the site on a Macbook Air 2017 and discovered that only if you purchase 2 different 'fair' quality books an order confirmation email is not sent to the user. This became an extensive bug and will be detailed below in the bugs section

## Bugs 

| Bug | Has this been solved? | How? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. When creating the Contact form I received an error stating 'cannot access local variable 'form' where it is not associated with a value' [e.g](/docs/bugs/bug1.png) | Yes | In contact views.py I defined a variable as contact = form.save() so I could access the form data and return/repeat this to the sender of the message in a confirmation email |
| 2. In the contact confirmation email entire form blocks were being returned and displayed to the user instead of just the input values like I intended, [e.g](/docs/bugs/bug2.png) | Yes | I realised I was using {{ form.name }} in the confirmation email txt file so I changed the Jinja template tag to {{ contact.name }} etc and the correct information was displayed |
| 3. The averagerating variable in my HTML templates displayed the average rating accurately but the admin value was a step behind. For example if I rated a book a 5, admin would show 0, then if I rated it a 3, admin would show 5 | Yes | I moved the code block 'product.averagerating = product.get_rating()' 'product.save()' after the review was initialised and saved within the add_book_review() function |
| 4. [This](/docs/bugs/bug4.png) bug occured when trying to checkout early on in development, the Stripe secret key and potentially other environment variables were not being loaded or accessed appropriately, preventing checkout | Yes | I created a .env file (which I ensured was covered by .gitignore) and declared my Stripe environment variables there, along with exporting them in the terminal and saving them to the Gitpod environment variables section |
| 5. [This](/docs/bugs/bug5.gif) bug rendered my quantity update button non-functional where if the quantity was altered and 'update' was clicked the page would refresh and revert back to the original quantity | Yes | I discovered that the placement of my text_quality code was potentially producing an additional quality parameter, [evidenced here](/docs/bugs/quantity-update-bug.png) and assigning the quality value from a string representing a number (on which calculations could be performed) to a string representing the text_quality value. I moved the relevant code and this became functional once again |
| 6. My most problematic and time-consuming bug was a bug related to the book quality being accurately logged and representing during and after checkout. As seen [here](/docs/bugs/bug6.png) in the admin an order would display the correct quality and price factor in the bag but after checkout was completed each book would be stored as a default quality of 'Great' meaning pricing was not being accurately calculated | Yes | With the help of tutor support I altered the book_quality field on my OrderLineItem model to a ForeignKey pointing to the Quality model so I could access it's price_factor field. I then overwrote the save function for the OrderLineItem model to calculate the lineitem_total by multiplying the product's full price by the relevant book quality price factor, multiplied by the quantity of items bought. I then had to calculate a quality_instance based on the product and it's price factor in order to save this to the OrderLineItem model so the price could be represented accurately in the checkout HTML templates |
| 7. After deploying my site to Heroku the Contact Form served a 'Server Error (500)' when the form was submit [e.g](/docs/bugs/contact-error.png). After setting DEBUG to True in Heroku Config Vars and settings.py I received the following [error message](/docs/bugs/contact-expanded-error.png) | Yes | I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73462412/how-can-i-fix-not-enough-values-to-unpack-expected-2-got-1) post on StackOverflow which suggested to remove trailing commas from the 'if request.method == 'POST':' block and this resulted in the form being successfully submit and an email being received |
